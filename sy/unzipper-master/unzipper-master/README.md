# The Unzipper

The Unzipper extracts .zip archives or .gz files on webservers. It detects .zip/.gz archives and let you choose which one to extract (if there are multiple archives available).

It's handy if you do not have shell access. E.g. if you want to upload a lot of files (php framework or image collection) as archive - because it is much faster than uploading each file by itself.


## Requirements    
PHP 5.3 and newer   
(If you still run 5.2 or even 5.3 you should consider updating PHP. These old PHP versions do not get any security updates and your site may be vulnerable.)


## Usage
* Download unzipper.php and place it in the same directory as your .zip archive.
* In Browser type URL to unzipper.php
* Choose .zip archive you want to extract
* Click "Unzip Archive"


## Version
Alpha version state, use at you own risk.
